        "### **Explanation**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Encapsulation**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - The class uses private attributes like `__survey_questions` and `__respondent` to hide implementation details from external access, ensuring that these variables are modified only through controlled methods.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  - Public methods like `start()`, `show_questions()`, and `show_responses()` provide a well-defined interface for interacting with the survey, keeping the underlying logic hidden.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  - This approach maintains data integrity and prevents unauthorized or accidental changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Input Validation**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - The private method `__validate_response()` ensures that each response matches the expected type and satisfies any additional constraints:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - For age and annual income, the response must be a positive number.\n",
        "  \n",
        "    - For satisfaction ratings, the response must be an integer between 0 and 10.\n",
        "  \n",
        "    - By validating inputs before adding them to the responses, the class avoids runtime errors and maintains data consistency.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Properties for Controlled Access**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Metadata like `company`, `survey_name`, and `survey_researcher` are accessible and modifiable through properties with getter and setter methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - This allows for controlled updates to these attributes while preventing direct modification of internal variables. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Dynamic and Flexible Question Handling**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - The `__survey_questions` attribute is a tuple of *named tuples*, making it easy to manage survey questions, their order, and expected types.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Adding a new question requires only modifying the `__survey_questions` tuple without changing the rest of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Mock Testing Capability**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - The `__mock_survey()` method provides a built-in way to populate the survey with predefined responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - This feature is especially useful for testing and debugging without having to manually input data every time.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Data Reset and Reusability**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - The `reset()` method allows clearing all responses and resetting the respondent, making the survey reusable for new participants.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - This supports multiple use cases, such as surveys conducted in a loop or across different sessions.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Error Handling**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Attempts to access data before it is available (e.g., `responses` or `respondent`) raise descriptive errors, ensuring users are guided to follow the correct sequence of operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Scalability and Extendability**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - The modular design makes it easy to extend the class:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  - Adding new questions or question types is straightforward.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  - Validation rules can be customized to handle more complex input formats.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  - Additional methods can be implemented for exporting or analyzing data.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Enhanced User Interaction**\n",
        "  \n",
        "  - The `start()` method provides a user-friendly way to walk through the survey. It prompts users sequentially for each question, validates their input, and stores the responses.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  - Invalid inputs are rejected with clear feedback, encouraging users to retry until the input is valid.\n"
