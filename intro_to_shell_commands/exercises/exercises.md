# Shell Command Exercises

Practice these exercises to familiarize yourself with basic shell commands. Start in an empty directory for the best learning experience.

## Exercise 1: Basic Navigation and File Creation

**Objective**: Practice basic file system navigation and file creation commands.

1. Create a new directory called `practice`
2. Navigate into the directory
3. Create two subdirectories: `documents` and `images`
4. List all directories to verify they were created
5. Navigate into `documents`, print the filepath of the `documents` directory, then back to `practice`

## Exercise 2: Working with Files

**Objective**: Practice creating, copying, and moving files.

1. In the `practice` directory, create a text file called `notes.txt`
2. Add the text "Hello, Shell!" to `notes.txt`
3. Create a copy of `notes.txt` called `backup.txt`
4. Move `backup.txt` to the `documents` directory
5. List the contents of both the current directory and the `documents` directory

## Exercise 3: File Content Manipulation

**Objective**: Practice reading and manipulating file contents.

1. Create a file called `shopping.txt`
2. Add these items (one per line): "apples", "bananas", "oranges"
3. Display the contents of the file
4. Add "grapes" to the end of the file
5. Display the file

## Exercise 4: Pipelines and Redirection

**Objective**: Practice combining commands and redirecting output.

1. Create a file called `names.txt` with 5 random names
2. Sort the names alphabetically and save to `sorted_names.txt`
3. Search for a specific name in the `names.txt` file
4. Use pipelines to display only the first 3 sorted names

## Exercise 5: File Finding and Counting

**Objective**: Practice using find, wc, and other utilities.

1. Create several files with different extensions: `.txt`, `.md`, `.csv`
2. Find all `.txt` files and count them
3. Create a file containing the list of all `.txt` files
4. Count the total number of files in all subdirectories

Here’s the revised exercise and solution for Exercise 6:

## Exercise 6: Searching Command Manuals

**Objective**: Practice using man, grep, and output redirection to find specific options in command manuals.

1. Use the man command to open the manual pages for `grep`, `awk`, and `sed`.
2. Use `grep` to find specific options in each command’s manual page.
3. Save the results to text files for future reference.

## Tips for Working on These Exercises:

1. Read each exercise completely before starting
2. Try to solve exercises without looking at solutions first
3. If stuck, break down the problem into smaller steps
4. After using the solution, try to understand each command
5. Experiment with variations of the commands

Remember: It's normal to consult the manual (`man` command) or help (`--help` flag) frequently while learning these commands.
